<h5>Notes on Sources and Calculations</h5>
<h6>Resource Data</h6>

<div class="sourcedatatext">Government Resource Revenue</div> data was shared by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the hackathon.<br>
It contains resource revenue estimates for 53 countries from 2000 to 2011. Please refer to the “Fiscal Regimes for Extractive Industries: Design and Implementation” for revenue estimation methodology.<p> 

<div class="sourcedatatext">Government Non-Resource Tax Revenue</div> data was also made available by the IMF for the hackathon. The dataset contains non-oil and non-mineral tax revenue (along with estimates from government revenue from resources) for 37 countries from 1992 to 2009. For more information on the dataset, please refer to the IMF Working paper 2014 “Resource Blessing, Revenue Curse? Domestic Revenue Effort in Resource-Rich Countries” by Ernesto Crivelli and Sanjeev Gupta.<p> 

The datasets shared by the IMF are an unofficial internal survey by the IMF and have not been verified by country authorities.<br>
For some countries for some years, Government Resource Revenue data was available from both of the above IMF sources.  In this case, the two numbers were averaged to obtain the value for this visualization.
Where Government Resource Revenue data was only available from one source, that value was used.<p> 

<div class="sourcedatatext">Rent</div> data is taken from the World Bank’s Development Indicators database and contain data for countries for the years 2000-2011, and is given as %GDP. 
<br>Oil, gas and coal rents are the difference between the production of crude oil, natural gas, and hard and soft coal at world prices and the total cost of production, respectively. 
<br>Mineral rents are the difference between the value of production for a stock of minerals at world prices and their total costs of production. Minerals included in the calculation are tin, fold, lead, zinc, iron, copper, nickel, silver, bauxite, and phosphate.<br>  
For purposes of this visualization, Oil and Gas rents are displayed as described above, however Coal and Mineral rents have been combined into a single "Mineral" group.<p>  
<div class="sourcedatatext">Total Rents</div> are the sum of Oil, Gas and Mineral rents, and is given as %GDP. <p>

Please note that the data are estimates by the World Bank staff using various production and price data/sources. For more information on methodology, please refer to “The Changing Wealth of Nations: Measuring Sustainable Development in the New Millennium”.<p>  

<div class="sourcedatatext">Government Take</div> is a ratio calculated as Government Resource Revenue / Total Rents.<p>

<h6>Classifications</h6>

Income classification is taken from the World Bank where economies are divided according to 2012 GNI per capita (calculated using the World Bank Atlas method). 
The groups are: Low income (USD 1035<), Lower Middle Income (USD 1036 – USD 4085), Upper Middle Income (USD 4086- USD 12615) and High Income (USD 12616 >). 
Income classification used is based on most recent classifications.<p> 

Regional classification is based on the United Nation’s classification.<p> 

Primary Rent Source is determined as the max of Oil, Gas and Mineral rents for a given country over the years 2000-2011.<p>
